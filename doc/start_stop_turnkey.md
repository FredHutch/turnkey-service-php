# Starting and Stopping the Turnkey

1. Start the turnkey

The Turnkey is automatically started when you install or update the Turnkey, but to start the Turnkey explicitly, simply issue the command:
```
scripts/start_turnkey.sh
```

2. Stop the turnkey

Similarly, once the Turnkey is running, if you want to stop the Turnkey for any reason simply issue the command: 
```
scripts/stop_turnkey.sh
```
